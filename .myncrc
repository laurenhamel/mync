# This is the main configuration file for Mync. It should
# use YAML syntax and formatting for its contents. Use this 
# file to configure Mync's internally recognized paths, like
# its preferred storage location.

# Set Mync's default storage location. In order for Mync to sync,
# across all of your devices, this should be set to a cloud storage
# drive, such as iCloud or Dropbox. By default, this is set to:
# STORAGE_VOLUME: ~/.CMVolumes/Dropbox
STORAGE_VOLUME: ~/.CMVolumes/Dropbox

# Set Mync's default storage directory name. This should be a
# directory inside the default storage location above that Mync
# will work with. By default, this is set to:
# STORAGE_DIRECTORY: Sync
STORAGE_DIRECTORY: Sync
