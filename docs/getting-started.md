## Getting Started

First, install Mync.

```
npm install -g mync
```

Then, before you can start syncing across workstations, you'll need to perform some initial setup:


1. Set your preferred storage location. See [Changing Storages](#changing-storages).

2. Configure Mync to find the items that you wish to sync. See [Managing Configurations](#managing-configurations).

3. Add items from your current workstation to storage that you want Mync to manage. See [Syncing Data](#syncing-data).

4. Backup your current system with `mync backup`.

5. Start syncing your workstation with `mync sync`.

6. Check the status of your workstation at anytime using `mync status`.

And finally, on your other workstations, install Mync and instantly backup your workstation and sync your settings with `mync sync`.
