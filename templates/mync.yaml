# For all synced files and folders, a 'source' and 'destination' location
# set need to be identified here. The 'source' location should match the folder
# or file name as it appears within the Sync folder. The 'destination' location
# should then indicate the target location that the folder or file should
# be synced to on the local machine.
#
# Example:
#   Adobe: ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe
